# Bite V1 Source Code

Just give us the credit in the discord bots bio.

## Dependencies

The only depedency for the project as of current is python itself and discordpy (installed with `pip install discord`).

## Bot Token

Because keeping the bot token public here is an idiotic idea, you have to use your own.

The way of doing this is creating a new file in the `src` directory called `bot_token.py`. The code in this file is very simple, just one like this with your token in the " ".

```py
bot_token = "Put your token here"
```

## Running

Simply run `python main.py` while in the `src` directory and you're good!
